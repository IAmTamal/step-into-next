**Issue Hunter** is a dummy application built with the help of `Next.Js` while learning more about it

- Learned Image optimization with `next/Image`.
- Links, headers and `_document.js` .
- Used `fs` to display and parse dummy data from json folders.
- Learned about SSG, SSR while loading the pages.
- Added dummy data ( might not work on deployment ) 

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
